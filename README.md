Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
 
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Can be defined as a part of computer science that involves the development, testing and maintenance of softwares. Software engineering is important because it is reliable, it ensures the software runs as required without and follows industry standards this is essential for industries like security , health or even finance. Efficiency, helps with the developer with workflow and ensures that the code is up to standard with requirements.Scalability and Flexibility, it also helps systems handle large data without it affecting performance.Security, it also addresses cybersecurity by using authentication , authorisation and encryption to safeguard user data from being breach. 



Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Mastering complexity, mastering process and mastering machine.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Planning : Identifying the softwares requirements from the clients and the company.
Requirement analysis: Get the BA or project manager , the final users specifications.
Design : Build the prototype or mode
Coding : Taking the prototype and coding it into a real software.
Test: Monitor and fix any bugs or errors that occur in the code.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology : Can be described as a step by step or orderly method where each phase is completed and then the next phase is started. 
	⁃	Tests are conducted at the final stages of development. 
	⁃	Customers only provide feedback at the end of the development of the software.
	⁃	Decreased flexibility: Changes are difficult to incorporate once development phase is complete
Agile methodology : Iterative and incremental approach, where the phases of the development have many cycles before.
	⁃	Tests are constantly conducted and done after every iteration.
	⁃	There is constant engagement with clients , recommendations are incorporated with every sprint in the project .
	⁃	Increased flexibility , easily adapts to changing software requirements.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer: Is responsible for developing applications , programs and systems using various programming languages and frameworks as guides.They also maintain and update the software to ensure its functionality.They are required to work closely with other team members to ensure there’s standard practice in development process.Consistent communication with project manager about project progress. 
	⁃	Quality Assurance Engineer: Building a relationship with stakeholders , to have a better understanding of their requirements for the software being developed. Designing frameworks and standards that the developers can follow. Monitoring if the software meets the requirements of the stakeholders. Analyse the developed product to determine if there’s any bugs to be removed or updates that need to be included. Develop and execute automation scripts using open source tools.
	⁃	Project manager: Deploys and leads the software development team.
Communicates the client requirements with the developers. Creates a prototype of the project . Monitors and tracks the progress and the project milestones. Delivers the complete product to the clients and takes feedback , for any positive changes.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE : is a platform used to develop software applications , by providing a space to write , compile and debug code with seamless features to decreases developmental difficulties. The IDE’s are created to understand the programming languages rules and helps the developer by indicating to them if rules are being infringed . The IDE clearly uses various formats to help the developer pick up on any syntax errors . The IDE even helps with giving suggestions on completing the statement, through prediction to make the developer me work more efficient. An IDE  complies and converts the code to a language the computers operating system can understand, converts human written code into machine code .Conducts automated unit tests before developer deploys code to more advance testing environments.A good example of an IDE is NetBeans 
Takes you through the bugs in your code line by line and clearly indicates which line the bug is lying. 
Version Control Systems : Software tool that helps the programmer with managing any updates made to the source code as time progresses a good example is GiT .
The importance of VCS is that it fosters collaboration and developers can work in the same code base without work redundancy. The ability to track any updates made to the software. The ability to incorporate new features into the main code. The ability to reverse changes if they give the programmer a error.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
The common challenges that are faced by software developers are Technology is constantly changing and it is difficult to keep up with what is new. Solution: For companies or the developer to arrange course or seminars to learn about these new technologies being implemented.
Time constraints , in software development time is essential and milestones have to be reached within schedule. Solution: Incorporate more agile methods of development like scrum to ensure milestones are consistently met , while the project is still continuing.
Changing software requirements, they are consistently changing and make it difficult for the developer to finish their development process . Solution: breaking down the system development into manageable independent components while having consistent communication with users for each component being developed ensure each requirement is accounted for. Programming secure softwares is a challenge for developers. Solution: IT Risk Management , research of the last cyber crimes in the tech world. 


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

Unit tests: They are closer to the source code and you can keep testing each method in the code of classes , components , or even modules.
Integrated tests :To ensure all the modules and services that are used in the application work seamlessly together.
System tests: Are for the whole software system, this involves the functionality and collaborative performance.
Acceptance tests : Tests if the systems meets the business requirements .


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering: Is a function where you prompt a generative AI solution to generate required outputs. Improves the users experience by providing users with information as required at their initial prompt without hassle. More flexibility, can make prompt using domain-neutral instructions that show the user’s patterns.Developer control : Provides developers more control of the users interactions with AI.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Planning : Identifying the softwares requirements from the clients and the company.
Requirement analysis: Get the BA or project manager , the final users specifications.
Design : Build the prototype or mode
Coding : Taking the prototype and coding it into a real software.
Test: Monitor and fix any bugs or errors that occur in the code.
